# Why C# is an OOP language??

* because the main method is always inside the class
* it provide the four pillers of oop encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism.
* encapsulation data hiding
* inheritance inherite classes
* abstraction only needed data will be shown to the system
* polymorphism- many forms of one type or a thing. complie time(method overloading) and run time(method overrideing

* class: user define data type
* object: instanse of a class 
1. class bags and the objects are travel bag, school bag, laptop bag, gym bag
2. class cloudeServices and objects AWS, AZUR, google cloud

### Constructor in C#

- Constructors are use for initializing the properties of an objects
- there are three types of constructor
	- default constructor
	- parameterized constructor
	- copy constructor
		- Want to create new object from exist object
- If we declare any parameterized or copy constructor then if we want to use default one then we also have to define the default one
- The constructor never return any value 
- It is one kind fo special method of a class
- It's name is ame as class name
- Construcotrs are called automatically when object of class is created
- In C# other two types of constructor are supported
	- Static Constructor
		- static keyword with constructor
		- not take any arguments
		- called only once
		- initialize the static members which belongs to class
	- Private Constructor
		- It si private and parameter-less
		- When all members of a class are static
		- Never allowed to create objects
